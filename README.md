Ever get bored while waiting for your code to compile? Do you sometimes just feel like you need a small break from all the coding?  

Presenting **TicTacToe** _inside_ VS Code!

## Features

Enjoy a quick game of TicTacToe right from the comfort of your own VS Code workspace. 

## Usage
Ok first open the repo in vscode. Please ensure you open the tictactoe folder. I.E lets say you save it as hacknight/tictactoe on your device do not open it on hacknight but directly the tictactoe folder.

next step:
Open terminal within Vs code and run the following:
npm install
npm run compile
npm run watch
after you run npm run watch the execution will not complete cause you are using watch which is the correct procedure, after this click f5 or run->start debugging
you might get a popup but click debug anyway
Then on the bottom taskbar on VS CODE you will see the extension running click on it and click enter when the run extension drop down is shown .
Then you will see the extension search window open:
DO : ctrl+shift+p  (mac users idk cmnd+shift+p i.e wtev the ctrl alternative is)
In the search bar type TicTacToe or `Start a new TicTacToe game` and voila click on it and youre there

If you find the startup confusing let the maintainer know but well will look into how much you have tried before any direct help .
